  1: Dealing with parties
    - Go through all groups of 2 or more members and combine their ratings to create one rating for the group
    - If the group can be paired against a group of equal strength or if any of the remaining solo players can be combined to form a group of sufficiently equal strength, the original group remains intact
    - Any groups that cannot be matched against a suitable group will be broken into solo players and balanced as such

  2: Placing paired groups
    - Each pairing of groups are iterated through and assigned to opposite teams
    - The team with the lowest combined rating picks first and selects the highest rated group

  3: Solo players
    - As long as there are players left to place
    - Whichever team with the lowest combined rating and is not full picks next
    - Said team always picks the highest rated group available
