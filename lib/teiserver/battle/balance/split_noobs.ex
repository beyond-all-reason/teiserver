  @moduledoc """
  Seperate players into noobs and experienced players. Noobs are players without a party and either
  high uncertainty or 0 rating. Experienced players are anyone not in the noob category.

  IF THERE ARE PARTIES
  The top 14 experienced players are fed into the brute force algorithm to
  find the best two team combination. To determine the top 14, we prefer players in parties, then prefer higher rating.
  The brute force algo will try and keep parties together and keep both team ratings close.

  Next the teams will draft the remaining experienced players preferring higher rating. Then the teams will draft the noobs
  preferring higher rank and lower uncertainty.

  IF THERE ARE NO PARTIES
  The teams will draft the experienced players first, preferring higher rating. Then they will draft
  the noobs preferring higher rank and lower uncertainty.
