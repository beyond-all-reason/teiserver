  Overview:
  The goal of this algorithm is to mimic how a human would draft players given the visual information in a lobby.
  Humans will generally avoid drafting overrated new players.

  Details:
  The team with the least amount of players will pick an unchosen player. If there are multiple teams tied for
  the lowest player count, then the team with the lowest match rating picks.

  Your team will prefer 3Chev+ players with high OS. If your team must pick a 1-2Chev player,
  it will prefer lower uncertainty.

  This is repeated until all players are chosen.

  This algorithm completely ignores parties.
