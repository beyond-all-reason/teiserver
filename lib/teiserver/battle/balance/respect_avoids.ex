  @moduledoc """
  A balance algorithm that tries to keep avoided players on seperate teams.

  High uncertainty players are avoid immune because we classify those as noobs and want to spread
  them evenly across teams (like split_noobs).

  Parties will have signficantly higher importance than avoids. To limit the amount of computation, the amount of
  avoids is limited for higher player counts.
