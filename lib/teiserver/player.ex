defmodule Teiserver.Player do
  @moduledoc """
  Context to handle anything player related when it comes to tachyon

  This context essentially bundles two concepts: connection and session.
  A connection is the actual websocket process that communicate with a player.
  A session is a process that can be used to check whether a player is connected.
  It is not directly linked to the websocket connection to allow more graceful
  reconnection of player if/when they crash.
