# Teiserver
An Elixir centralised/middleware game server. Originally an alternate implementation of [Uberserver](https://github.com/spring/uberserver) as used by Spring RTS games. Currently implementing only the Spring protocol but later I plan to create a new and more modern protocol and am open to implementing other existing protocols. Being written in Elixir it takes full advantage of the Erlang OTP for a very concurrent application with very low demand on system resources.
