Teiserver makes use of the Phoenix pubsub. This document is designed to list the different channels and how they are used.

Anything prefixed with "legacy" is something only present because of the nature of the spring protocol and is going to be removed as soon as we're able to.
Anything prefixed with "teiserver" is something added after the spring protocol was implemented and follows better practices with clearer documentation.

Teiserver channels always send a map as the object and include the channel name (as a string) under the `channel` key.
