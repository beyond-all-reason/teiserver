## Testing
Run as above (`mix run --no-halt`) and load up Chobby. Set Chobby's server to `localhost`. In my experience it's then fastest to restart Chobby and it will connect to your locally running instance. After you've finished you'll want to set the server back to `road-flag.bnr.la`.

You can login using the normal login command but it's much easier to login using `LI <username>` which is currently in place for testing purposes. `test_data.ex` has a bunch of existing users for testing purposes but you can use the protocols `REGISTER username password email` command to create a new user. State is currently not persisted over restarts. If you are familiar with Elixir then starting it with `iex -S mix` will put it in console mode and you can execute commands through the modules there too.
