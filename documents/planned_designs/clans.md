Clans are public, organised and managed groups of players. Clans will have one or more leaders and potentially as functionality expands, additional tiers of membership/authority. Clans should be able to take part in clan-only events and have a separate leaderboard.

## Server/Backend
- Clan being a property of user, not part of their name itself (thus rename not required)
- Clan TS/MMR rating, maybe something even more in-depth on a clan-clan relationship?

#### Nice to haves
- Clan announcements
- Clan chat (is this going to bring value when most clans might just have a discord?)
- Planetwars/Campaign mode, clans compete for territory
- Challenges, rewards/levels for completing them
- Stats, lots and lots of stats
- A way to handle clan tag being part of a name such as Fire[Z]torm
